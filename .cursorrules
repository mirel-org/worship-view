# Cursor Rules for Worship View Project

## Code Quality Checks
After making any code changes, always run these commands in order to verify everything works:
1. `pnpm lint` - Check for linting errors
2. `pnpm type-check` - Verify TypeScript types are correct
3. `pnpm package` - Ensure the application builds successfully

These checks should be run after:
- Adding or modifying components
- Updating dependencies
- Changing configuration files
- Any refactoring or code changes

## Project Context
- This is an Electron application using React, TypeScript, and Webpack
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling (not styled-components)
- Uses shadcn/ui components (not Material-UI)
- Package manager: pnpm (not npm or yarn)
- Always use pnpm commands: `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, etc.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS
- Use shadcn/ui components from `src/renderer/components/ui/`
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
